 # **PROJECT SPECIFICAIONS**

 ### PROJECT NAME:  cc_gen

## **OVERVIEW**
The cc_gen is an online digital library of credit card design which enable users to view,
    download and make use of credit cards samples as a resource in their own project.
    It's an easy to use library where designs are displayed in a gallery format and categorised based on certain
    features. Users are able to sign up with unique username, create, personalise, manage, modify card
    design and save progress without losing their work of data.

Among other use cases, this application is designed to give designers and developers access to resources to
    create web apps with credit card payment features such as online payment applications, e-commerce stores, e.t.c

  * The frontend development
  * The backend development

  # The Design
  The following tools were used:
  
* Pencil
* Figma
* FigJam
* Google forms

The project is subject to industry standard design stages which are:
  
* Empothise
*  Define
* Ideate
*  Prototype
* Test

  * [SKETCH & MOOD BOARD](https://www.figma.com/file/arUoplQyx97uDy98ueGfGe/Credit-Card-Library-Project?node-id=4%3A21&t=fHKUNYyKe7rcMNIe-0) 

 # **The Frontend**
 
  The following tools were used:
  
 1. HTML, CSS. 
 1.  React - A JavaScript library for easy addition of the funtionalities and building user interfaces
 1. Tailwind CSS - for styling
 1. Flexbox
 1. React Router - for navigation to different sections of our web pages
 1.  Fonts Awesome - for icons
 ## Product Specialization
 1. Mobile Phone.
 1. Ipads.
 1.  We are also implementing the desktop first design, as we believe most people who would want to use the
    CC_Gen library would be accessing it from a desktop or laptop.
#  **The Backend**
  The Django framework is used to create and operate CC_Gen. It is a Python-based web framework that uses
    the model-views-template (or MVT) architectural design pattern.

Although it's not necessary to be familiar with the Django framework to use this web application, it might be a good idea if you want to modify the way rhe back-office functions or add new features. You can modify every line of code ad every configuration to suit your requirements.
